Open Dylan 2015.1 Release Notes
*******************************

Introduction
============

This document describes the 2015.1 release of Open Dylan, released
XXX XX, 2015.

* `Download the release <http://opendylan.org/download/index.html>`_
* `Report bugs <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues>`_
* `Source code <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/tree/v2015.1>`_

C-FFI
=====

* Nested C structs by value are now supported by the C backend. Previously,
  using this construct would result in a compilation error in the generated
  C code.

Compiler
========

* The compiler emits warnings for issues with ``define sealed domain``:

  * Incorrect number of type specializers provided. The number of type
    specializers must match the number of required parameters for the
    generic function.
  * Type specializers are not subtypes of the corresponding required
    argument of the generic function.

    For example, this is useful for catching an incorrect sealing of
    ``make``:

    .. code-block:: dylan

       define sealed domain make (<my-class>); // Wrong
       define sealed domain make (singleton(<my-class>)); // Correct

system
======

* New specializations on :drm:`as` have been added for creating locators
  from strings for the ``<file-system-directory-locator>`` and
  ``<file-system-file-locator>`` classes. These aren't typically used but
  their omission led to possible confusion for users.

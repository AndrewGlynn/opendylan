How to contribute to Open Dylan
*******************************

- We use spaces for indentation rather than tabs in our source
- Please read the `Dylan style guide <http://opendylan.org/documentation/style-guide/index.html>`_
- We adhere to the proposed `Naming Conventions <http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Naming_Conventions>`_


- We use `Vincent Driessen's branching model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_ (see `gitflow <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/>`_ for tool integration)
- We don't separate master from develop branch, but we develop in master
- We also emphasize `this note about git commit messages <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_


- Open Dylan is licensed under MIT, we expect contributions to be the same
- Open Dylan is of collective authorship of the "Dylan Hackers" collective
